<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Nuage de points</h2>
<p>Dès que vous vous sentez familiarisé avec les principes de base de R, vous allez pouvoir réaliser assez rapidement des beaux graphiques. Par exemple, si vous souhaitez représenter une variable numérique en fonction d’une autre variable numérique, vous pouvez exprimer cela sous la forme d’une <strong>formule</strong><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y \sim x\]</span></p>
<p>que l’on peut lire “y en fonction de x”. Pour les deux variables numériques <em>x</em> et <em>y</em>, la représentation graphique la plus classique est le <strong>nuage de points</strong> (voir Fig. <a href="nuage-de-points.html#fig:first-scatterplot">4.1</a> pour un exemple).</p>
<pre><code># Warning: Using `as.character()` on a quosure is deprecated as of rlang 0.3.0.
# Please use `as_label()` or `as_name()` instead.
# This warning is displayed once per session.</code></pre>

<p>La fonction <code>chart()</code> n’est pas accessible dans R de base, mais l’extension chargée via l’instruction <code>SciViews::R</code> rend cette fonction disponible. Elle requiert comme argument le jeu de donnée (<code>data = urchin</code>, c’est un objet <code>dataframe</code> ou <code>tibble</code> dans le langage de R), ainsi que la formule à employer dans laquelle vous avez indiqué le nom des variables que vous voulez sur l’axe des ordonnées à gauche et des abscisses à droite de la formule, les deux membres étant séparés par un “tilde” (<code>~</code>). Vous voyez que le jeu de données contient beaucoup de variables (les titres des colonnes du tableau en sortie). Parmi toutes ces variables, nous avons choisi ici de représenter <code>height</code> en fonction de <code>weight</code>, la hauteur en fonction de la masse des oursins. Jusqu’ici, nous avons spécifié <em>ce que</em> nous voulons représenter, mais pas encore <em>comment</em> (sous quelle apparence), nous voulons les matérialiser sur le graphique. Pour un nuage de points, nous voulons les représenter sous forme de … points ! Donc, nous devons ajouter la fonction <code>geom_point()</code> pour indiquer cela.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Echelles d’un graphiques</h3>
<p>Vous devez être vigilant lors de la réalisation d’un nuage de point particulièrement sur l’étendue des valeurs présentées sur vos axes. Vous devez utilisez votre expertise de biologiste pour vous posez les deux questions suivantes :</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Est ce que l’axe représente des valeurs plausibles de hauteurs et de masses de ces oursins appartenant à l’espèce <em>Paracentrotus lividus</em> ?</p></li>
<li><p>Quels est la précision des mesures effectuées ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Dans certains cas, la forme du nuage de points peut être distendu par la présence de valeurs aberrantes. Ce n’est pas le cas ici, mais nous pouvons le simuler en distendant artificiellement soit l’axe X, soit l’axe Y, soit les deux :</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> Transformation des données</h3>
<p>Vous avez la possibilité d’appliquer une transformation de vos données (il est même conseillé de le faire) afin qu’elles soient plus facilement analysables. Par exemple, il est possible d’utiliser des fonctions de puissance, racines, logarithmes, exponentielles<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> pour modifier l’apparence du nuage de points dans le but de le rendre plus linéaire (car il est plus facile d’analyser statistiquement des données qui s’alignent le long d’une droite). Par exemple, sur nos données de hauteurs et masses d’oursins, la transformation double-logarithmique (log(x) <em>et</em> log(Y)) fonctionne très bien pour rendre le nuage de points plus linéaire :</p>

<h5>Pièges et astuces</h5>
<p>RStudio permet de récupérer rapidement des instructions à partir d’une banque de solutions toutes prêtes. Cela s’appelle des <strong>snippets</strong>. Vous avez une série de snippets disponibles dans la SciViews Box. Celui qui vous permet de réaliser un graphique en nuage de points s’appelle <code>.cbxy</code> (pour <strong>c</strong>hart -&gt; <strong>b</strong>ivariate -&gt; <strong>xy</strong>-plot). Entrez ce code et appuyez ensuite sur la tabulation dans un script R, et vous verrez le code remplacé par ceci dans la fenêtre d’édition :</p>
<pre><code>chart(data = DF, YNUM ~ XNUM) +
  geom_point()</code></pre>
<p>Vous avez à votre disposition un ensemble de snippets que vous pouvez retrouver dans l’aide-mémoire consacré à <a href="https://github.com/BioDataScience-Course/cheatsheets/blob/master/keynote/sciviews_cheatsheet.pdf"><strong>SciViews</strong></a>. Vous avez également à votre disposition l’aide-mémoire sur la visualisation des données (<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/"><strong>Data Visualization Cheat Sheet</strong></a>) qui utilise la fonction <code>ggplot()</code> plutôt que <code>chart()</code> et une interface légèrement différente pour spécifier les variables à utiliser pour réaliser le graphique (<code>aes(x = ..., y = ...)</code>).</p>

<p>Une nouvelle tâche va vous être demandée ci-dessous en utilisant GitHub Classroom <a href="#classroom"><strong>??</strong></a>. Cette tâche est un travail <strong>individuel</strong>. Une fois votre assignation réalisée, faites un clone local de votre dépôt et placez-le dans le sous-dossier <code>projects</code> de votre dossier partagé avec la SciViews Box <code>shared</code>. Vous aurez alors un nouveau projet RStudio <a href="#rs-projet"><strong>??</strong></a></p>

Les instructions R que vous expérimentez dans un learnR peuvent être employées également dans un script d’analyse. Sur base du jeu de données <code>urchin_bio</code>, explorez différents graphiques en nuages de points. Utilisez l’URL suivante pour accéder à votre tâche :

<p>Inspirez-vous du script dans le dépôt <code>sdd1_iris</code>. Vous devez commencer par faire un “fork” du dépôt, puis un clone sur votre ordinateur en local pour pouvoir l’utiliser.</p>

<p>Prêtez une attention toute particulière à l’organisation d’un script R. En plus des instructions R, il contient aussi sous forme de commentaires, un titre , la date de la dernière mise à jour, le nom de l’auteur, et des sections qui organisent de façon claire le contenu du script. A ce sujet, vous trouverez des explications détaillées concernant l’utilisation des scripts R dans l’annexe <a href="#script"><strong>??</strong></a>.</p>
